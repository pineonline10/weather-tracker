# weather-tracker
##Purpose
This code allows the user to visit the webpage and pull weather information. The user can get information on the current weather of a certain city, as well as a five-day forecast in that city.

This is important because it allows people to plan their activities and commutes accordingly. The UI is clean and presents the user with pertinent information as well as icons that present the information even quicker. 

I used a ton of help from Stack Overflow forums, the Open Weather Map website, and Chat GPT. A lot of what is here could be improved - style-wise, functionality, and diversity - but, it should be functional and useful.![Alt text](./Image%209-5-23%20at%2010.33%20AM.jpg)
